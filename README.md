# coffeeTimer
# this is CS50
I completed CS50 and this website is my final project. It is a simple timer application that decides how many grams of water you need to pour for any given amount of coffee beans you want to brew.

The website is written with HTML and CSS. Animations are programmed using JavaScript and Jquery.

Have fun drinking coffee!
