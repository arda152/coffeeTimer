                    Coffee is a plant ( Coffea ) and the name of the drink that is made from this plant. The coffee plant is a bush or tree that can grow up to ten meters (about 32 feet) high, but is usually cut shorter. Coffee plants originally grew in Africa , and now
                    also grow in South America , Central America and Southeast Asia . They are an important crop for the economies of many countries. The drink is made from the seeds of the coffee plant, called coffee beans. Coffee is usually served hot,
                    and is a popular drink in many countries. Coffee contains a chemical called caffeine, a mild drug that keeps people awake.

                <li>The best coffee is made from the best beans. Make sure the roast date is not older than a month.</li>
                <li>Grind your beans to your preferred setting. Usually filter coffee is the middle range on the grinder.</li>
                <li>Wet your filter and place the ground coffee in it.</li>
                <li>Then comes the bloom. The grounds get soaked and the CO2 leaks out. This process takes around half a minute and results in a more balanced cup.</li>
                <li>After the bloom, you can pour the water continuously for 2-3 minutes, until you reach the desired amount.</li>
